However, when making apps for other devices, developers are often unable to find the analog for new platforms. This is where Elastic comes in, offering a desktop experience consistent with pull to refresh.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\nProvide a wrapper for your page content; the `body` won't work as the `body` cannot be wrapped\r\nby another element.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"main\">\r\n<!--\r\n\tcontents of website...\t\r\n-->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTell the jQuery plugin how to handle the refreshing of a given wrapper.\r\n```javascript\r\n$(\"#main\").pullToRefresh(function(finishedRefreshCallback) {\r\n\t// refresh content... \r\n\tputList();\r\n\t\r\n\t// ...then tell pullToRefresh to finish\r\n\tsetTimeout(finishedRefreshCallback, 1e3);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
